Once connected to the controller and a serial port, use putty to login to the controller.

Connection settings
baud: 115200
data bits: 8
stop bits: 1
parity:None

To enter the service menu press Ctrl-Break and then press S (case sensititive).

The default password is supportDell

Here you can view and change the management IP address.

Select from the menu options shown to view or modify the port settings:

    Option 1 to view the current management port configuration-
    Option 2 to modify the current management port configuration-
    Enter a period (.) to make no changes and return to default settings 

If you are having serious issues with the array and need to get to lower level commands, you can do the following.

Press Ctrl-Break
Instead of hitting S press Esc
You should get a vxWorks login:
Username: shellUsr
passsword: DF4m/2>

Note: itâ€™s much easier to copy and paste the user/password into the putty terminal. Just right click to paste.

Common commands:

lemClearLockdown

sysWipeAllConfigData

    Caveat: the above command wipes the configuration. If you have data you need, do NOT run the above command. You can type SysWipe to get a list of all reset commands, including nondestructive options.

netCfgShow

When finished, type Ctrl+D to save your changes and exit.

That should be it really.
